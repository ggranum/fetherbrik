/**
 * The system has permissions such as CAN_DELETE_GROUP, users and roles have those permissions combined with an
 * enabled or disabled state.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if a Role has the permission "Can Delete Foo", and I want to add Sam but know that
 * he's going to screw everything up thanks to the delete rights, I can assign Sam to the Role and disable
 * the Delete permissions just for him.
 * <p/>
 * It also allows 'child' Roles to remove a permission from an inherited role, helping to avoid Role explosion.
